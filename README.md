## The story

Seeing the animations behind Paper, or the transitions behind Mail, being in a world of flat design and transitions, user interaction, app behavior and responsiveness are key, we need good and fast animations to delight our users in every tap, every scroll, every moment that they spend in our app.

After lots of apps, designs and animations, after trying some of the most famous web frameworks for animations and after I learnt FramerJS, which has one of the most beautiful springs I've seen. I'm building a collection of the knowledge I said when I learnt iOS development I would do. Walker, an animation engine and library.

## Code

To do animations the code used will be similar to this:

```
animate(firstView) {
  $0.alpha(1)
}.chain {
  $0.width(300)
}.finally {
  print("Animation done")
}
```
