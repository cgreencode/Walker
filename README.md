## The story

One year and a half ago I became an iOS developer, I was happy, I knew how to do iOS apps, but static ones. I saw the animations behind Paper, or the transitions behind Mail, and I was impressed, I wanted to do that. After trying and trying, I did some great animations, I learnt FramerJS, which, in my opinion, has some beauty in it's springs, and I felt in love with it. Trying to learn more and more, I saw an article that talked about the animations in UIKit, and I started to investigate about spring, I saw that, putting a timing on it didn't make sense, and that's the reason why I want to bring the perfect animation to iOS development, the, in my opinion best platform to develop on.

## Code

The animation library will try to simplify the code that we are using and the way we are using it. You'll be able to apply animations to views, and layers at some point.
